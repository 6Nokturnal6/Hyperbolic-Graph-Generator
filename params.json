Embedded in the hyperbolic plane, these networks naturally exhibit two common properties of real-world networks, namely power-law node degree distribution and strong clustering. Moreover, other well-known graph ensembles, such as the soft configuration model (SCM), Erdos-Renyi (ER) graphs, or random geometric graphs (RGGs), appear as degenerate regimes in the model. \r\n\r\n|                  \t| T = 0          \t| T in (0,inf)        \t| infinite T               \t|\r\n|------------------\t|----------------\t|---------------------\t|--------------------------\t|\r\n| gamma in [2,inf) \t| Hyperbolic RGG \t| Soft Hyperbolic RGG \t| Soft Configuration Model \t|\r\n| infinite gamma   \t| Spherical RGG  \t| Soft Spherical RGG  \t| Erdos-Renyi              \t|\r\n\r\n\r\nThe user selects a regime by specifying appropriate values of γ and T. If **γ >= 10**, then γ is considered infinite. If **T >= 10**, then T is considered infinite. The threshold values of these infinities can be modified by changing the HG INF TEMPERATURE and HG INF GAMMA definitions in the package.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
