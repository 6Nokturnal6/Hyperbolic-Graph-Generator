Embedded in the hyperbolic plane, these networks naturally exhibit two common properties of real-world networks, namely power-law node degree distribution and strong clustering. Moreover, other well-known graph ensembles, such as the soft configuration model (SCM), Erdos-Renyi (ER) graphs, or random geometric graphs (RGGs), appear as degenerate regimes in the model. \r\n\r\n|                  \t|      T = 0     \t|     T in (0,inf)    \t|        infinite T        \t|\r\n|------------------\t|:--------------:\t|:-------------------:\t|:------------------------:\t|\r\n| γ in [2,inf) \t| Hyperbolic RGG \t| Soft Hyperbolic RGG \t| Soft Configuration Model \t|\r\n|   infinite γ \t|  Spherical RGG \t|  Soft Spherical RGG \t|        Erdos-Renyi       \t|\r\n\r\nThe user selects a regime by specifying appropriate values of γ and T. If **γ >= 10**, then γ is considered infinite. If **T >= 10**, then T is considered infinite. The threshold values of these infinities can be modified by changing the HG INF TEMPERATURE and HG INF GAMMA definitions in the *lib/hg_formats.h*.\r\n\r\nA complete description of the Hyperbolic Graph Generator tools is available @\r\nA brief description of the mathematical models support the Hyperbolic Graph Generator is available at\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe Hyperbolic Graph Generator has been designed and implemented by Chiara Orsini (@chiaraorsini), and Rodrigo Aldecoa (@raldecoa).
