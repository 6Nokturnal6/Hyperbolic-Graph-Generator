{"name":"Hyperbolic-graph-generator","tagline":"A set of tools to generate synthetic graphs embedded into a hyperbolic space and to test the greedy routing.","body":"### Welcome to the Hyperbolic Graph Generator Pages.\r\nThis software implements and extends the network model described in [Hyperbolic Geometry of Complex Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5169). Embedded in the hyperbolic plane, these networks naturally exhibit two common properties of real-world networks, namely power-law node degree distribution and strong clustering. Moreover, other well-known graph ensembles, such as the soft configuration model (SCM), Erdos-Renyi (ER) graphs, or random geometric graphs (RGGs), appear as degenerate regimes in the model. \r\n\r\n\r\n-> insert table here\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
